Also implemented a simple posting client, so that I could call it from my KPhotoAlbum to Flickr uploader and announce when I had new pictures (something I sometimes announce on Zephyr too, but it seems slightly less appropriate to automatically post there, and I currently only do when there's something of note.)</p><p>Found an interesting article comparing the author/audience aspects of RSS vs. Twitter - it seems that the Twitter dynamic manages to be simultaneously more casual <i>and</i> more engaging, which perhaps deserves a little thought.</p><h3>Footnotes:</h3><ul><li> KPhotoAlbum <a href="http://www.kphotoalbum.org/">http://www.kphotoalbum.org/</a></li><li> Flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eichin/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/eichin/</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/twitter-followers-vs-rss-subscribers/">http://www.dailyblogtips.com/twitter-followers-vs-rss-subscribers/</a></li></ul><a name="Tue_Nov_18_22:09:00_2008" /><h2>Tue Nov 18 22:09:00 2008</h2><p /><p>On a whim, refactored to support <tt>@replies</tt> too; I'm not sure if the 100/hour applies to each interface or any, but "two every 90s" is still only 80/hour.  (Also not sure if the change particularly works, since the one <tt>@</tt>-reference to me wasn't the first one in the message.  It's rather straightforward, though.)</p><p>It's run quietly for two days now; I did get one <tt>502 Bad Gateway</tt> which is apparently "returned if Twitter is down or being upgraded"; looks like all of the 5xx codes can be handled by sleeping a little extra rather than outright failing, so I've added that too.</p><a name="Sun_Nov_16_17:02:00_2008" /><h2>Sun Nov 16 17:02:00 2008</h2><p /><p>The API docs say "100/hour", "please use if-modified-since", "basic auth only", and "xml, json, rss, or atom."</p><p>json is first-class in later versions of python, so let's use <tt>simplejson</tt> for now. That gives us an array of twits, which are just dicts; looks like I want <tt>t["text"]</tt> for the body, <tt>t["user"]["screen_name"]</tt> for the fake sender, and ignore the rest for now; maybe add the reply, location, or <tt>user.name</tt> in the zsig later, and maybe filter on <tt>user.protected</tt> if that actually turns out to mean something.</p><p>Since etag/if-modified-since seem reliable enough, I won't bother stashing messages at all, just history.</p><p>Yay brute force.  27m total including some manual testing.</p><h3>Footnotes:</h3><ul><li> api doc <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/REST+API+Documentation">http://apiwiki.twitter.com/REST+API+Documentation</a></li></ul><p /></body></html>
