The MIT Zephyr Notification system is something I worked on in the
late 1980's, and 20+ years later it is still supported and used (in a
fairly narrow niche.)  For historical reasons, there is a small niche
of users within that niche who treat Zephyr as their primary instant
messaging platform, and gateway other things to it; thus, a Twitter
gateway and posting client.

ztwitgw takes the timeline, replies, and favorites, and sends them as
individual "ZephyrGrams".  It was recently ported to tweepy in order
to get Oauth support; this works, but I still haven't figured out how
to not-distribute the consumer_secret.

zpost is like the classic Zephyr "zwrite" - an easy to use
fire-and-forget message sender, the kind of thing that made it easy to
integrate notification into everything (print queuing, builder loops,
test loops, anything you could run a shell command from.)  My biggest
current use of it is for posting summaries of picture-upload batches
directly from my kphotoalbum flickr upload tool.  It's also now on
tweepy, with the same caveats about consumer_secret.

(See README-thok or the upstream link for dev history; this was pulled
in to github using git-cvsimport.)
