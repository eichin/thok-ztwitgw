The MIT Zephyr Notification system is something I worked on in the
late 1980's, and 20+ years later it is still supported and used (in a
fairly narrow niche.)  For historical reasons, there is a small niche
of users within that niche who treat Zephyr as their primary instant
messaging platform, and gateway other things to it; thus, a Twitter
gateway and posting client.

ztwitgw takes the timeline, replies, and favorites, and sends them as
individual "ZephyrGrams".  Note that it used basicauth... and then
when that went away, used the twitterandroid backdoor.  Now that
that's gone (though it came back to life for a few bursts in early
2011) this code needs to use OAUTH - I've stalled long enough on
hoping that twitter would come up with something less atrocious for
non-web clients, but it's pretty clear that's not going to happen, so
development of OAUTH support (probably based on tweepy) will happen here.

zpost is like the classic Zephyr "zwrite" - an easy to use
fire-and-forget message sender, the kind of thing that made it easy to
integrate notification into everything (print queuing, builder loops,
test loops, anything you could run a shell command from.)  My biggest
current use of it is for posting summaries of picture-upload batches
directly from my kphotoalbum flickr upload tool.  It *also* needs to
add OAUTH support.

(See README-thok or the upstream link for dev history; this was pulled
in to github using git-cvsimport.)
